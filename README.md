Redmine Plugin: Timesheet Log User
==================================

Allows logging time on behalf of other Redmine users. 

Note that it doesn't check any permissions, so only use this plugin if all
redmine users are trusted. (Pull requests welcome!)

Tested with Redmine 1.4 and 2.6.

For an alternative approach, see [this patch against redmine core](http://www.redmine.org/issues/3848).
